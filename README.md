Bayesian Inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MTH707 Project)

This repository contains my course project for MTH707: Markov Chain Monte Carlo at IIT Kanpur.
The project explores the theoretical and practical aspects of MCMC algorithms with applications to Bayesian inference.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Studied key theoretical concepts: ergodicity, reversibility, convergence rates of Markov chains.

Implemented multiple MCMC algorithms in R:

Metropolis-Hastings

Gibbs Sampling

Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA)

Conducted convergence diagnostics, variance estimation, and efficiency analysis.

Applied MCMC to Bayesian models and visualized posterior distributions.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

Language: R

Libraries/Packages: ggplot2, coda, MCMCpack, dplyr

ðŸ“Š Results

Compared convergence speed and efficiency across different samplers.

Demonstrated Bayesian inference on synthetic and real datasets.

Visualized posterior distributions and trace plots for performance evaluation.
